        Froot Salad is an individual personal project of mine and isn't an
        actual business. With that said, and based on how the website operates,
        I'm not entirely sure if I really even need a privacy policy, but I want
        to ensure that I'm doing my best to be transparent and in compliance
        with website regulations. So I've attached an official privacy policy
        that I created through the use of the service termify.io.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm">
        I also wanted to include the following handwritten note because I feel
        that the privacy policy from termify.io can seem a bit too formal and
        legalistic for my small personal website.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm bold">
        I would like to start by stating that this website doesn't collect
        personal data, as you've probably noticed. The only data that is
        collected is anonymous gameplay data, which is used solely for the
        purpose of enhancing the game experience, and Google Analytics 4 data
        which is used to track website analytics.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm bold">
        The gameplay data is currently just saved in the browser's local storage
        tool and gets deleted when you clear your browser or cache data.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm bold">
        The Google Analytics data is collected using cookies, which you can
        always disable in your browser settings if you choose to do so. The sole
        purpose of this data collection is to try and help me gauge how I'm
        doing with user engagement. Please feel free to research Google
        Analytics 4 and its privacy policies if you have any concerns.
      </p>
      <p className="text-sm">
        If you have any other questions or concerns about your privacy while
        using the site, or if you have any tips for me on how to improve my
        practices, please email me at parkerglas@gmail.com or reach out to me
